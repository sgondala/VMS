    <p><u>
         Our culture - Learn, Implement, Grow - and have fun
    </u></p>
    <p>
         We regularly solicit feedback from our customers. This helps us understand what we are doing wrong and what we are getting right. This feedback is invaluable for us. And we have you, our customers, to thank for taking time off to write back to us. There are times when there are hiccups. It's a learning organization, but we are learning the ropes like our lives depend on it.
    </p>
    <p>
         It doesn't stop at that. We ensure that the same mistakes are not repeated. People are encouraged to speak their minds and they don't fear sharing their mistakes, so that everyone can benefit from the learning, no matter how small.
    </p>
    <p>
         Every other day new partnerships are forged - all with the aim of adding more value and convenience for our customers. We have grown organically by opening offices in key metros and inorganically through our partnerships. We encourage customers to let us know of any routes or bus operators we don't have in our list. We go right ahead and make sure that by the next time a customer logs on, we have on offer what was demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
         Most importantly, it's a team that has fun at work. It's a team that is close knit. Everyone is on a first name basis and it wouldn't be uncommon to see people exchanging hi-fives on small achievements. Office outings are a regular phenomenon and dancing is a must.
